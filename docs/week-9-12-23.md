## Working MVP

### Goals:
- Debuggable action application 
- Basic visualization (to flesh out)
- Support multiple agent behaviors 
- Create metrics to evaluate environments and agent behaviors 
- Simulation supports 
    - Multiple goods
    - Multi-tick journies (edge distances)

### Metrics for individual agent
- total coins
- coins per tick
- died?

Metrics for population of agents
- min, max, median, mean, std of agent coins

How well did the agents equalize prices?
- box plot of prices
- stddev of pricesf

Construct 'trades'
- bought Cargo at StartPort for BuyPrice
- sold Cargo at EndPort for SellPrice
- profit = SellPrice - BuyPrice
- Route = StartPort -> .. ->  EndPort
- RouteLength = len(Route)
