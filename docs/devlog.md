# Devlog

## Tue 9/12/23
- I want to have a "thing" by the end of this week's work-break
- Want to introduce branch discipline 
- Want to figure out how to use a debugger w/ rust
- Want a crash report file that can be loaded up so crash can be reproduced (and looked at with debugger!)
- By eod want a good debugging workflow for applying actions
- Note: would like to refactor logic out of obj methods and into free 
  functions that operate on objects


## Wed 9/6/23
- Took off work early, want to spend afternoon making debugging great
- Possibilities: When there's an error: (OR)
    - history obj has error saved on it
    - python error contains full state
    - write history to file 

## 2023 8/31/2023 Thursday

- Reorienting myself with the codebase
    - Ran into `Invalid Action: tried to sell when impossible`
        - Hard to debug
        - What was the situation when this occurred? 
        - Can we capture more information to make debugging easier?
